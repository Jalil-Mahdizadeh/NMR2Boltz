# nmr2boltz

`nmr2boltz` converts proton-containing distance restraints in **NEF** and **NMR-STAR** into conservative heavy-atom upper-bound contacts suitable for the `atom_contact` extension in BoltzUI/Boltz-2.

It is deliberately not a blind text converter. The program separates four different operations that are often conflated:

1. parsing the STAR data model and preserving restraint-group logic;
2. mapping source chain/sequence identifiers onto the exact Boltz input sequence;
3. resolving each proton to its directly bonded heavy atom from chemical topology;
4. projecting an upper bound with an explicit mathematical policy and quarantining unresolved OR ambiguity.

The default output contains only contacts that can be imposed **simultaneously** without changing the logical meaning of the source restraints.

## Installation

Python 3.10 or newer:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
pytest
```

Basic conversion:

```bash
nmr2boltz convert experiment.nef -o converted
nmr2boltz convert entry.str -o converted
```

For data lacking an explicit upper limit, the safe default is rejection. A heuristic may be requested explicitly:

```bash
nmr2boltz convert experiment.nef \
  --missing-upper-policy target-plus-uncertainty \
  -o converted
```

For modified residues, provide a local wwPDB Chemical Component Dictionary file or directory:

```bash
nmr2boltz convert experiment.nef --ccd ./ccd -o converted
```

When the source numbering does not match the exact Boltz input, provide a tab-separated map:

```text
source_chain  source_sequence_code  source_residue_name  boltz_chain  boltz_residue_index
A             24B                   GLY                  A            25
```

```bash
nmr2boltz convert experiment.nef --residue-map residue_map.tsv -o converted
```

The safer production path also supplies the exact Boltz input. Conversion stops
before writing executable constraints if a mapped chain, residue index, declared
modification, or residue identity is incompatible with that target:

```bash
nmr2boltz convert experiment.nef \
  --target-yaml boltz_input.yaml \
  -o converted
```

## Docker

Build:

```bash
docker build -t nmr2boltz:0.1.0-validated .
```

Keep real inputs and outputs under `workspace/` and mount that directory at
`/workspace` for every run:

```bash
docker run --rm --network none --read-only --tmpfs /tmp:size=64m \
  -v "$PWD/workspace:/workspace" \
  nmr2boltz:0.1.0-validated \
  convert /workspace/input/experiment.nef -o /workspace/output/converted
```

The image runs as numeric UID/GID 65532 by default. On Linux, add
`-u "$(id -u):$(id -g)"` if host-owned output files are preferred.
The validated image identifier, digest, offline/non-root smoke evidence, and
6M6O reproduction are recorded in [`VALIDATION.md`](VALIDATION.md).

## Reproducible benchmarks

`nmr2boltz benchmark` runs one or more conversions from a versioned YAML
manifest, verifies optional SHA-256 checksums, validates the sequence mapping
against the exact Boltz target, and compares observed audit metrics with pinned
expectations:

```bash
nmr2boltz benchmark workspace/benchmark.yaml \
  -o workspace/output/benchmark
```

Each case records its complete conversion bundle and a suite-level
`benchmark_summary.json`. A target mismatch, checksum mismatch, conversion
exception, or changed expected metric fails that case without preventing the
remaining corpus from running.

The paired-format deposited-structure corpus is run separately so that each
NEF/NMR-STAR pair is compared against every PDB conformer with sequence-aware
coordinate alignment:

```bash
python validation/benchmark_corpus.py benchmark/input \
  --output-directory benchmark/output \
  --reviewed-baseline benchmark/reviewed_baseline.json
```

Each PDB ID is written under `benchmark/output/<PDB-ID>/{nef,star}`. The root
`BENCHMARK_REPORT.md` and `benchmark_summary.json` record coordinate
satisfaction, conservative implication checks, and exact atom-pair/bound parity.
`FORMAT_DISCREPANCY_AUDIT.tsv` contains one traceable row for every NEF-only,
STAR-only, or different-bound contact, including source rows, expressions,
canonical expansions, resolved proton sets, pseudoatom handling, pair count,
averaging policy, source/projected bounds, and classification.
Files with valid sequence data but no distance-restraint loop produce an empty,
auditable conversion instead of failing format detection.

An `expected_format_difference` is accepted only through a tested semantic
allowlist: wildcard atom set versus explicit OR members, x/y assignment versus
a compatible physical set, rejected geometric Q/M pseudoatoms, or a verified
canonical naming alias. Unknown representation or rejection differences remain
`unresolved` and fail CI.

The reviewed scientific interpretation of the current corpus is documented in
[`docs/BENCHMARK_DISCREPANCY_FINDINGS.md`](docs/BENCHMARK_DISCREPANCY_FINDINGS.md).

The corpus command is also a fail-closed CI gate. It exits nonzero for any
projection implication failure, unresolved format discrepancy,
parser/projection bug, changed discrepancy digest, changed scientific metric,
or changed reviewed missing-coordinate set. Known coordinate limitations are
pinned by every contact identity, bound, source provenance, and a digest; they
are not count-only waivers.
Replacing the baseline is deliberately explicit and must follow scientific
review:

```bash
python validation/benchmark_corpus.py benchmark/input \
  --output-directory benchmark/output \
  --reviewed-baseline benchmark/reviewed_baseline.json \
  --write-reviewed-baseline
```

## BoltzUI integration

The emitted YAML has the form:

```yaml
constraints:
  - atom_contact:
      atom1: [A, 17, CG1]
      atom2: [A, 42, CB]
      max_distance: 8.009
      force: true
```

Merge the list into the same Boltz input that defines the corresponding chains and sequences. The current BoltzUI patch requires Boltz-2, `force: true`, and inference with potentials enabled. It also accepts distances only in the interval 2–20 Å. The converter therefore:

- raises a projected value below 2 Å to 2 Å, which weakens the restraint;
- never clips a value above 20 Å, because clipping would strengthen it;
- reports an over-20 Å value instead of emitting it.

## Projection policies

For an explicit proton pair with experimental upper bound `U`, directly bonded parents `P1/P2`, and conservative X-H bond-length envelopes `l1/l2`, the converter uses the triangle inequality:

```text
d(P1,P2) <= U + l1 + l2 + margin
```

For H-X only one X-H term is added. For heavy-heavy input no X-H term is added.

An atom-set expression such as `HG1%` may represent several proton pairs. The default `--averaging sum-r6` policy assumes the unnormalized effective distance

```text
r_eff = (sum_i r_i^-6)^(-1/6)
```

and uses the rigorous existence bound

```text
min_i(r_i) <= N^(1/6) U
```

for `N` explicit proton pairs. `--averaging mean-r6` uses the normalized mean convention and factor 1. `--averaging hard-or` also uses factor 1 and treats the source as an existential assignment alternative. The correct policy depends on how the deposited bounds were calibrated and whether pseudoatom/atom-set corrections were already incorporated.

## Ambiguity rules

The converter distinguishes:

- **atom set with one parent**, for example `VAL HG1% -> CG1`; this can collapse safely;
- **atom set with several parents**, for example `TYR HD% -> CD1 OR CD2`; this remains an OR group;
- **non-stereospecific x/y assignment**, which remains an assignment alternative unless all choices share a parent;
- **geometric Q/M pseudoatom**, which is rejected by default because it is not the same object as a wildcard atom set;
- **multiple rows with the same restraint ID**, which are treated as alternatives, not independent simultaneous contacts;
- **non-null restraint-combination identifiers or non-OR NMR-STAR member logic**, which are preserved but not flattened because they may encode nested logic.

Inside one OR group, two alternatives that map to the same heavy pair are combined using the **larger** bound. Across independent restraint groups, duplicate heavy pairs are combined using the **smaller** bound.
If any alternative or atom-set branch in an OR group cannot be projected safely, none of the remaining alternatives are emitted because a partial OR would be stronger than the source restraint. Executable upper bounds are rounded upward at six decimal places so serialization never tightens them.

## Safe workflow for structure generation

1. Run the converter with default policies and inspect `sequence_map.tsv` first.
2. Use `boltz_constraints.yaml` as the high-confidence guidance set.
3. Run multiple Boltz diffusion samples rather than relying on one structure.
4. For ambiguous data, either implement union-aware potentials or generate several assignment hypotheses with `--hypotheses`.
5. Reconstruct hydrogens on candidate structures using an NMR-aware protonation/geometry tool.
6. Re-evaluate the original NEF/NMR-STAR restraints, including atom-set averaging and ensemble behavior, and rank/filter structures by violations.
7. Compare restrained and unrestrained predictions to detect over-guidance or numbering mistakes.

## Important limitations

- An NOE upper bound is an experimental/modeling restraint, not necessarily a literal hard instantaneous distance.
- Dynamic and conformational-ensemble averaging is not reproduced by a single heavy-atom contact.
- Exchangeable protons depend on protonation, tautomer, solvent, pH, and temperature.
- The compact built-in topology covers standard proteins and common RNA/DNA residues. Modified components should use embedded NMR-STAR chemistry or a local CCD file.
- The current Boltz token-conditioning path cannot encode a disjunction. Marking every OR alternative as a contact would overconstrain the model.
- A soft Boltz potential encourages a contact but does not guarantee restraint satisfaction. Post-prediction validation remains mandatory.
- Paired NEF and NMR-STAR exports can encode different atom-set multiplicities; inspect `format_parity.json` before treating them as interchangeable.
